 Building a predictive model (i.e. a machine learning classifier) capable of distinguishing between “bad” traffic, called intrusions or attacks, and “good” normal traffic.
<br>
<br>
This is a group task with individual element, and you will work in a group of 5 students.<br>
Tasks to be completed:<br>
• Team forming<br>
• Planning<br>
• Searching literature<br>
• Pre-processing<br>
• Selecting features<br>
• Exploring and selecting ML algorithms<br>
• Refining ML algorithms<br>
• Evaluating model and analysing the results<br>
• Future work<br>
