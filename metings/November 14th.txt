Agenda:
1. Complete the “planning” phase as far as possible. Count in the complexity of each stage as well as iterability timewise.
2. Assign individual responsibilities for sections of the project
3. Sort out conventions for how we’re going to work in the github repository: version control, directory structure (data, experiments, model, report), report draft with literature links.
4. Sid to update the team on goals/results of pre-processing stage.


Recommendations from :https://blog.floydhub.com/structuring-and-planning-your-machine-learning-project/
1. Use the same software/packages/versions. Anaconda installation https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-keras-tensorflow-using-anaconda-for-machine-learning-44ab28ff39cb
2. Checkpoint ML model versions that perform the best, e.g. parameters. Leaving comments in the code may help.
